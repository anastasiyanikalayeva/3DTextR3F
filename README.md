# 3DTextWithR3F

The **3D Text with R3F** project demonstrates how to create an interactive 3D scene using **React Three Fiber (R3F)** and **Three.js**. In this project, I focused on rendering 3D text with beveled edges, surrounded by animated torus-shaped objects, providing an engaging and dynamic user experience. The project uses **MatCap textures** for lighting effects and utilizes React components for seamless integration with Three.js.

This project was developed as part of my learning journey at Three.js Journey course to enhance my **WebGL** and **3D animation** skills, providing both a creative and technical challenge.

## Features

- Interactive 3D text with smooth bevel and animation.
- 100 randomly positioned and animated torus meshes.
- MatCap material for stylized lighting effects.
- Responsive camera controls with **OrbitControls**.
- Use of **React Three Fiber** for integrating Three.js into React projects.

## Technologies

- **React Three Fiber (R3F)**: A React renderer for Three.js that allows seamless integration of Three.js in React applications.
- **Three.js**: A powerful 3D JavaScript library for rendering 3D graphics in the browser.
- **React**: The JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **WebGL**: A web standard for rendering 3D graphics in the browser.
- **MatCap Textures**: Used for creating realistic shading and lighting effects in 3D objects.
